# Metronome
By C. Marshall Moriarty
### A easy-to-use metronome with a conductor assistant too.


# Stretch Goal
- Create a 'My Songs' section where users can save songs of their chosing for various BPMs.
    - This would initally use local storage.
    - Would prefer this to have a drag and drop functionality instead of a button add.
    - Add user creation/authentication and transition My Songs to a database.
- Add beat patterns section that is dynamically updated based on time signature.
- Transition metronome notes to actual notes.
- Add subdivide function.
